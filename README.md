# DyPamear: Efficient and Scalable Dynamic Graph Pattern Mining on Practical Processing-in-Memory Architecture

**DyPamear** is an efficient **dynamic graph pattern mining (DGPM)** system for the UPMEM **Processing-in-Memory (PIM)** architecture.

The goal of DyPamear is to accelerate incremental pattern-aware execution of DGPM using UPMEM DPUs. It integrates **asynchronous pipelining**, **bitmap-based set intersection**, and other optimizations tailored for near-data processing architecture.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- Load-aware task distribution for balanced execution across thousands of DPUs.
- Asynchronous loader–worker pipeline using WRAM FIFO.
- Bitmap-based set intersection acceleration on DPUs.
- Lightweight performance profiling and cycle analysis tools.

## ⚙️ Build and Run Instructions

To match a pattern within a graph, run:

```bash
make clean
GRAPH=<graph_name> UPDATES=<updated_edges> PATTERN=<pattern_name> make test
```

Example:

```bash
GRAPH=WK UPDATES=WK_updates PATTERN=CLIQUE3 make test
```

> 💡 The available values for `GRAPH` and `PATTERN` are defined in `include/common.h`.  
> To add new graphs or patterns, modify `common.h` and recompile.

## 🧩 Customized Graphs and Matching Patterns

DyPamear supports flexible definitions of graph inputs and matching patterns.

All configuration entries are defined in `include/common.h`.

### ➕ Adding Custom Graphs

1. Place your input graph (in CSR binary format) into the `./data/` directory.
2. Add a macro definition in `include/common.h`:

```c
#if defined(AM0312)
#define DATA_NAME "amazon0312_adj"
#define N (1<<20)
#define M (1<<23)
#endif
```

3. Build and test:

```bash
GRAPH=WK UPDATES=WK_updates PATTERN=CLIQUE3 make test
```

### ➕ Adding Custom Patterns

1. Define a new macro for your pattern kernel in include/common.h

```c
#elif defined(TELE5)
#define KERNEL_FUNC tele5
#define PATTERN_NAME "tele5"
#endif
```

2. Implement the kernel function in dpu/ directory (e.g., in TELE5.c or new source file).
3. Build and run:

```bash
GRAPH=WK UPDATES=WK_updates PATTERN=TELE5 make test
```

## 📈 Scalability Testing

DyPamear is designed to scale from hundreds to tens of thousands of DPUs.

### 🔧 Custom DPU Count

To run DyPamear on a specific number of DPUs:

```bash
GRAPH=WK UPDATES=WK_updates PATTERN=CLIQUE3 EXTRA_FLAGS="-DV_NR_DPUS=5120" make test
```

### 📊 Full Scalability Sweep

To automatically benchmark DyPamear from **640** to **20,480** DPUs:

```bash
GRAPH=WK UPDATES=WK_updates PATTERN=CLIQUE3 make test_sc
```

This script:

- Compiles DyPamear with various DPU counts.
- Runs the benchmark for each configuration.

## 📊 Profiling & Visualization Tools

### `analyze_csr_graph.py`

Analyzes CSR binary and outputs graph statistics:

```bash
python3 python_tool/analyze_csr_graph.py input/graph.bin
```

Outputs include:

- Number of nodes and edges
- Degree distribution (min/avg/max)

---

### `show_cycle.py`

Visualizes DPU-level workload distribution:

```bash
python3 python_tool/show_cycle.py result.txt
```

- Left plot: Max cycle per DPU
- Right plot: Task count per DPU
